It is a computation model. It is simplified and ideal virtual machine for mathematical discussion about computers.
 It was suggested by an English mathematician, Alan Turing. A computation model is said to be Turing Complete when it has the same computational ability as a virtual universal Turing Machine. 
Turing Completeness is a criterion which a programming language must satisfy.
